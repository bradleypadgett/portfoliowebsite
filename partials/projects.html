      <p class="card-text">Reverse-engineering Niagara’s architecture and codebase to rebuild it into a generalized, stack-driven node framework for authoring tools and custom editors in Unreal Engine. Designed modularly using MVVM patterns, built to support systems engineers and technical artists creating extensible editor workflows.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Painterly Stylized Shaders</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Developed two lightweight principled shaders for all assets, structured modularly using material attributes, functions, and instances. Focused on minimizing texture samples and shader instruction count, with platform-quality switches for hardware scalability. Also built Editor Utility tools to optimize mesh vertex counts and to streamline bulk-asset migration into the new stylized shader pipeline.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Niagara Sailing FX</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Leveraged Niagara’s Grid2D Simulation Stages to dynamically bake collision query data into a localized render target, enabling tileable intersection masks for shaders and particle FX. Landscape and water shaders used the system to drive sand displacement and ripple effects. Also implemented Gerstner wave height sampling for splash FX, integrated alongside responsive sailing and drifting gameplay mechanics.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Lantern Festival</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Built editor tools integrating Niagara with Procedural Content Generation tools, enabling precise control over lantern scattering and foliage set-dressing. Lanterns were modeled entirely in-engine, leveraging Substrate’s BSDF-based shaders and MegaLights to drive thousands of optimized, fully dynamic lights.</p>
